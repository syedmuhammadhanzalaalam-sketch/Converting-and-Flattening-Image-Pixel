# Converting-and-Flattening-Image-Pixel
This project demonstrates how to load an image using Python, convert it to grayscale, and flatten its pixel data into a 1D feature vector using NumPy and PIL. It helps in preparing image data for machine learning models by reducing dimensionality and converting visual data into numerical format.
